As a father in high school. Private activities are required before public activities. Sharing my story to the California State Tax Board allowed me open a case against the County of Los Angeles. I pay you $100 per session. If you find away to make your duty easy. Pay the person $25 per session. Have a manager present to verify the transaction.
